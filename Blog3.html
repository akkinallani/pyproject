    <h1 class="title"> How High School Students Can Advocate for Tech Equity in Their Communities
</h1>

      Teens today are some of the most tech-savvy people around—but not all of them have equal access to devices or the internet. That’s where student advocacy comes in. High schoolers can play a huge role in pushing for more equitable technology access, both in and out of school.

Here are a few ways to get started:

1. Survey Your School – Create an anonymous survey to find out how many students have reliable internet or personal devices. The results can help drive funding conversations.

2. Start a Tech Drive – Organize a device donation campaign for students who need laptops, tablets, or chargers.

3. Talk to School Leaders – Meet with your school board or principal to discuss adding Wi-Fi hotspots or tech tutoring programs.

4. Partner with Local Libraries or Nonprofits – Many groups already support digital literacy—see how your school club can help.

5. Tell Your Story – Write an op-ed, share a video, or speak at a school assembly about why tech access matters.

When students lead, people listen. Advocacy doesn’t need to be loud to be powerful—it just needs to be persistent. Whether through action, words, or community-building, high schoolers can spark real change in the digital divide.
