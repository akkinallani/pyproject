    <h1 class="title"> How Detroit’s “Connect 313” Is Fighting the City’s Internet Inequality</h1>

        In the heart of Detroit, an ambitious initiative called "Connect 313" is transforming how communities access and use the internet. Detroit, once one of the least connected major U.S. cities, now serves as a blueprint for community-based digital equity. Connect 313 is a collaboration between the city government, the Rocket Community Fund, United Way for Southeastern Michigan, and over 1,000 community members.

        The program focuses on more than just internet access. Through neighborhood technology hubs, training sessions, and free device distribution, Connect 313 aims to empower Detroiters with the skills needed to succeed in an increasingly digital world. It also tracks data to ensure neighborhoods most in need receive support first. Local residents help run the program, ensuring that solutions reflect real community needs.

        One standout example is the Community Tech Workers program. These workers, often from the very neighborhoods they serve, go door-to-door helping residents troubleshoot tech issues, apply for broadband discounts, or learn how to use email. It’s a grassroots effort with lasting results, showing that the digital divide isn’t just about infrastructure—it’s about people. In just two years, internet adoption in targeted zip codes increased by over 35%, with thousands of new users gaining access to digital services.
