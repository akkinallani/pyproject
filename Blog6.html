       San Antonio’s Central Library has turned an unused wing into a fully equipped Tech Lab, offering everything from high-speed internet to 3D printers. But it’s not just a maker space—it’s a launchpad for opportunity.

Local residents use the lab to apply for jobs, take coding classes, or finish online school. Tech mentors, often volunteers from nearby universities, guide users through everything from setting up email accounts to mastering Microsoft Excel. The lab also provides tablets and hotspots for checkout, helping bridge the home connectivity gap.

During the pandemic, the Tech Lab became a lifeline for remote workers and learners alike. Its impact shows that even traditional institutions like libraries can be key players in closing the digital divide, especially when they provide tools and training. Since launching, it’s helped over 10,000 residents improve their digital skills and has become a model for library-based innovation across Texas.
