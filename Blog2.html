    <h1 class="title"> New Texas Law Aims to Expand Rural Internet Access
</h1>

      In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 9 into law—a major step toward closing the state’s rural internet gap. The bill allocates nearly $1.5 billion for broadband expansion, creating a new Texas Broadband Infrastructure Fund to help bring service to more than 7 million residents who currently lack reliable internet.

The law focuses on building out infrastructure in rural and remote regions, where laying fiber-optic cable has historically been too expensive for private companies. By offering public funding and incentives, the state hopes to make these projects more feasible.

State Rep. Trent Ashby, one of the bill’s authors, emphasized the importance of rural connectivity for education, business, and emergency services. “High-speed internet is no longer a luxury. It’s essential,” he said.

Communities in East Texas and the Panhandle are expected to be among the first to see upgrades. Local leaders have welcomed the news, saying it levels the playing field for students and small business owners alike.
