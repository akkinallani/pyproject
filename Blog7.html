    <h1 class="title"> How North Carolina’s “Great Grant” Expanded Fiber to Forgotten Counties</h1>

        In Beaufort County, North Carolina, many homes didn’t have access to even basic broadband until 2022. That changed thanks to the state’s GREAT (Growing Rural Economies with Access to Technology) grant program. By awarding millions to ISPs like Brightspeed and ATMC, North Carolina helped build out fiber networks to places private companies had long ignored.

But this isn’t just about wires in the ground. The program requires ISPs to offer affordable plans and provide performance transparency. Residents like Sheila R., a retired teacher who previously relied on her phone for internet, say the change is "life-changing." Now, she video chats with her grandkids, attends virtual book clubs, and even tutors online.

North Carolina’s GREAT program shows how targeted, accountable funding can make a real difference. It’s a model that other rural states are starting to follow. To date, over 300,000 households have gained access through this program—turning forgotten corners of the state into digitally thriving communities.
