    <h1 class="title"> How Milwaukee’s Digital Literacy Lab Helped Veterans Reboot Their Careers</h1>

        In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Milwaukee saw a deepening digital divide—especially among veterans transitioning to civilian life. For many, lacking the right tech skills meant being shut out of modern employment opportunities. That’s when a partnership between EveryoneOn and Employ Milwaukee, the city’s workforce development board, stepped in with a powerful solution: the Digital Literacy Lab.

The lab is more than a classroom—it’s a launchpad. Participants receive a device at the start of the four-week program and learn the essentials: using email, browsing safely, navigating job search engines, and working with web-based apps. For veterans like Raymond H., who served in logistics but had never used a laptop for work, the program was transformative. “I was always told I had the discipline and mindset for civilian work,” he said, “but I didn’t have the tech know-how. This lab gave me that.”

EveryoneOn helped provide affordable connectivity and refurbished devices, while Employ Milwaukee tailored the curriculum to support not only veterans but also older adults and job seekers in shelters. The result? More than just new résumés—real digital confidence.

One standout feature of the lab is its mobility. It operates in libraries, workforce centers, and even temporary shelters, bringing digital skills to the doorstep of those who need them most. And with many veterans seeking flexibility and remote roles, the training directly maps to real opportunities in today’s workforce.

Since its launch, the Digital Literacy Lab has served hundreds of Milwaukee residents. Veterans who once struggled with basic forms or online portals are now applying for benefits, attending virtual interviews, and helping others in their communities do the same.

Milwaukee’s model highlights what real digital equity looks like: not just handing out laptops, but embedding training, empathy, and opportunity into every click. As more cities look to support veterans in the digital age, this lab offers a smart, scalable blueprint.
