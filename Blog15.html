    <h1 class="title"> Meet Johnny Matheny: The Man With a Mind-Controlled Bionic Arm
</h1>

      Johnny Matheny lost his arm to cancer—but gained a chance to test the future of human-machine connection. As one of the first recipients of a DARPA-funded bionic limb, Johnny can control the robotic arm with his thoughts.

The arm is connected to sensors implanted in Johnny’s residual limb, which pick up nerve signals and transmit them to a computer. With practice, Johnny can pour a drink, type, and even shake hands. “It feels natural,” he says. “Like I’m getting part of myself back.”

Beyond movement, the latest version includes pressure sensors, allowing Johnny to feel whether he’s gripping something too tightly or not enough.

Johnny works with researchers at Johns Hopkins University to refine the technology. His feedback helps engineers make the arm more intuitive and responsive. For him, this is about more than mobility—it’s about agency. “I’m not a passenger in my life anymore,” he says. “I’m back in control.”
