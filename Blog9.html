    <h1 class="title"> How a VR Frog Dissection at Ashland Middle School Changed Science Class</h1>

        Ashland Middle School in Kentucky faced a challenge: budget cuts had limited hands-on science labs. Enter Froggipedia, an educational VR app that lets students dissect a frog in 3D space.

Instead of scalpels and specimens, students use VR headsets to explore internal organs, muscle systems, and bone structure. Science teacher Mr. Weller noticed a 30% boost in quiz scores after implementing the app. "Kids who were squeamish or disengaged suddenly leaned in."

VR in the classroom isn’t about replacing teachers—it’s about enhancing experiences. In Ashland, it helped level the playing field for under-resourced students and gave science class a new lease on life. The school has since expanded its VR curriculum to include units on the solar system, ecosystems, and human anatomy.
